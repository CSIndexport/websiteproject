    <h1>ABOUT Soccer</h1>
    <p>
      Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team
      sport played between two teams of 11 players each who primarily use their
      feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. Just recently, the world
      cup was won by Argentina. Real Madrid has the most UCL titles.

    <h3>How to Play soccer?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The ball must cross the goal line to score.</li>
      <li>The team with the most goals wins.</li>
      <li>
        The goalie is the only player who can touch the ball with their hands.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are no timeouts. Soccer uses a running clock, which means the game
        continues even if a player is injured.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the ball goes out of bounds, the team who didn't touch it last gets
        to throw or kick it back in.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a player commits a foul or offense, the other team gets a free kick.
